# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CS50 pset6. Ported credit from c to python. 

**Thoughts:** Using code from c in python was not advantageous at all. Originally I made use of C's declaration types to be able to do all sorts of division without worrying about the ints turning into floating point numbers. I do not have that luxury in python. I made it work by making extensive use of math.floor but it's ugly I would much rather rewrite the code.

* ["credit.c"](r1d0/credit.c)

### Day 1: January 14, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: CS50 pset6. Ported crack from c to python.

**Thoughts**: Ugh, why are strings immutable in python. Caused me to hit a massive brick wall that took a bit of work to overcome. But I stayed the course and calmed myself down and thought through it. Was about to shelve it for the day when I tried out one more idea that seems to work. The IDE seems to be giving me some issues now though. I'll finish it off tomorrow.

**Link(s) to work:** 
* ["crack.py"](r1d1/crack.py)
* ["crack.c"](r1d1/crack.c)

### Day 2: January 15, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: CS50 pset6. Started work on similarities.

**Thoughts**: Reviewed some python principles. Don't really understand how this matrix is supposed to work. But the connections are slowly forming. Unfortunately I have some other things to get done so I'll have to be content with only an hour today.


### Day 3: January 16, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: CS50 pset6. Wrote psuedocode for similarities.

**Thoughts**: I had no idea how to start at first, but I broke it down into a piece I thought I could manage and figured out how to do that. Played around with a test file to see how matrixes(list of lists) work in python. Good lesson in shaking off that overwhelmed feeling and getting to work.


### Day 4: January 17, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: CS50 pset6. Almost finished similarities algorithm.

**Thoughts**: Really did not want to code today. And now I've done an hour more than I intended. I have something that barely functions, definitely some bugs I need to work out but I'm much further along than when I started. It's mostly figuring out this minimal values thing....and I think I fixed that bug. I had to try one more thing while writing this down. I should hopefully be onto the web aspect of the pset now.

### Day 5: January 18, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: CS50 pset6. Got the matrix displaying on web using jinja2 and flask.

**Thoughts**: Took a while to figure out what jinja2 was doing and how to get it to cooperate. But I picked through the docs and slowly it started to make sense. The A-ha moment came when I finally realized python loops are truly different and I wasn't iterating a number from 0 my counter was literally the character from the string I had told it to iterate over. If that makes any sense. I'm very tired. But I'm very happy I still put in my work before bed.


### Day 6: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Lecture 8 for CS50. Not much to report.

**Thoughts**: Python and html and bootstrap and sql oh my.


### Day 7: January 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started in on pset7. 

**Thoughts**: Had to look over the distribution code for quite a while to figure out what was going on but it's starting to make sense. Lots of things going on with sql, bootstrap, python, and jinja2 all working together. But I'm catching on.


### Day 8: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed register route. 

**Thoughts**: Hopefully that'll kind of work as a keystone so I have a much better idea of what I'm doing going forward. The blocks are falling into place. :) A few minor obstacles but nothing I couldn't work around.


### Day 9: January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed quote route. 

**Thoughts**: Went much smoother than the register route, even with jinja2 and what not. Little by little working through the specs.


### Day 10: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed buy and index routes.

**Thoughts**: Made good progress. Just need the sell and history routes/pages now. And to fix a few things. Overall it's looking good and I'm understanding how things are getting pieced together.


### Day 11: January 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the sell route and modified the db to make history easier to implement.

**Thoughts**: Sell route was not too difficult. And with the database changes history should be a breeze.


### Day 12: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Implemented history. Discovered critical bugs.

**Thoughts**: Well it looks like I've got a bit more work to do. I was almost finished, until I realized how wrong my logic was. I hadn't tested well. Spent the next hour fixing those errors.


### Day 13: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished bugs, added bonus features, fleshed out the css(bootstrap).

**Thoughts**: CSS is super hard to edit without having a dynamic preview. Restarting the server everytime is way too much work. I'm sure there is an easier way. Regardless, the page looks nice enough and I like the functionality I added. I'm content with the finished product.


### Day 14: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Lecture about javascript and jquery and ajax.

**Thoughts**: A lot going on in this next problem set. Going to need to focus.


### Day 15: Jaunary 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: These docs and distribution code.

**Thoughts**: My head is spinning, but the understanding is coming. I can do this.
