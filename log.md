# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CS50 pset6. Ported credit from c to python. 

**Thoughts:** Using code from c in python was not advantageous at all. Originally I made use of C's declaration types to be able to do all sorts of division without worrying about the ints turning into floating point numbers. I do not have that luxury in python. I made it work by making extensive use of math.floor but it's ugly I would much rather rewrite the code.
