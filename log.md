# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CS50 pset6. Ported credit from c to python. 

**Thoughts:** Using code from c in python was not advantageous at all. Originally I made use of C's declaration types to be able to do all sorts of division without worrying about the ints turning into floating point numbers. I do not have that luxury in python. I made it work by making extensive use of math.floor but it's ugly I would much rather rewrite the code.

### Day 1: January 14, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: CS50 pset6. Ported crack from c to python.

**Thoughts**: Ugh, why are strings immutable in python. Caused me to hit a massive brick wall that took a bit of work to overcome. But I stayed the course and calmed myself down and thought through it. Was about to shelve it for the day when I tried out one more idea that seems to work. The IDE seems to be giving me some issues now though. I'll finish it off tomorrow.

* ["crack.c"](r1d1/crack.c)

### Day 2: January 15, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: CS50 pset6. Started work on similarities.

**Thoughts**: Reviewed some python principles. Don't really understand how this matrix is supposed to work. But the connections are slowly forming. Unfortunately I have some other things to get done so I'll have to be content with only an hour today.


### Day 3: January 16, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: CS50 pset6. Wrote psuedocode for similarities.

**Thoughts**: I had no idea how to start at first, but I broke it down into a piece I thought I could manage and figured out how to do that. Played around with a test file to see how matrixes(list of lists) work in python. Good lesson in shaking off that overwhelmed feeling and getting to work.
