# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CS50 pset6. Ported credit from c to python. 

**Thoughts:** Using code from c in python was not advantageous at all. Originally I made use of C's declaration types to be able to do all sorts of division without worrying about the ints turning into floating point numbers. I do not have that luxury in python. I made it work by making extensive use of math.floor but it's ugly I would much rather rewrite the code.

### Day 1: January 14, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: CS50 pset6. Ported crack from c to python.

**Thoughts**: Ugh, why are strings immutable in python. Caused me to hit a massive brick wall that took a bit of work to overcome. But I stayed the course and calmed myself down and thought through it. Was about to shelve it for the day when I tried out one more idea that seems to work. The IDE seems to be giving me some issues now though. I'll finish it off tomorrow.
